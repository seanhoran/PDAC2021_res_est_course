The practise of variogram fitting should be treated as more than just a curve fitted to data points exercise. The experimental variogram can be impacted by lack of data, sampling bias, clustering and the proportional effect. 
The objective of this exercise is to try and picture what the variogram model for the different spatial grade distributions presented looks like. A seasoned resource geologist will already have a variogram in their mind prior to doing any exploratory variography. The points plotted on the graph are merely a confirmation of the hypothesis.

Assume the figures measure 100m by 100m.
